    "\n",
    "We'll begin with the `read_excel` method, that let us read Excel files into a `DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method supports both XLS and XLSX file extensions from a local filesystem or URL and has a broad set of parameters to configure how the data will be read and parsed. These parameters are very similar to the parameters used on the `read_csv` method. The most common parameters are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `filepath`: The path to the file to be read.\n",
    "- `sheet_name`: Strings are used for sheet names. Integers are used in zero-indexed sheet positions. Lists of strings/integers are used to request multiple sheets. Specify None to get all sheets.\n",
    "- `header`: Index of the row containing the names of the columns (None if none).\n",
    "- `index_col`: Index of the column or sequence of indexes that should be used as index of rows of the data.\n",
    "- `names`: Sequence containing the names of the columns (used together with header = None).\n",
    "- `skiprows`: Number of rows or sequence of row indexes to ignore in the load.\n",
    "- `na_values`: Sequence of values that, if found in the file, should be treated as NaN.\n",
    "- `dtype`: Dictionary in which the keys will be coulmn names and the values will be types of NumPy to which their countent must be converted.\n",
    "- `parse_dates`: Flag that indicates if Python should try to parse data with a format similar to dates as dates. You can enter a list of column names that must be joined for the parsing as a date.\n",
    "- `date_parser`: Function to use to try to parse dates.\n",
    "- `nrows`: Number of rows to read from the begininning of the file.\n",
    "- `skip_footer`: Number of rows to ignore at the end of the file.\n",
    "- `squeeze`: Flag that indicates if the data read only contains one column the result is a Series instead of a DataFrame.\n",
    "- `thousands`: Character to use to detect the thousands separator.\n",
